TO DO
 * split up run_phylo_cnv in separate modules for species abundance, gene +/-, and snps

IN PROGRESS

CHANGES

2015-08-26
 * run_phylo_cnv.py: capable of running three different programs (species, genes, snvs)
 * phylo_cnv.py: split up into three separate modules (species.py, pangenome.py, snvs.py)

2015-08-26
 * added merge_genes.py: new script for building multi-sample gene matrix
 * phylo_cnv.py: report gene summary statistics
 * phylo_cnv.py: genes now reported in sorted order
 * phylo_cnv.py: fixed bug in read_ref_to_cluster function

2015-08-23
 * all positions now reported in snps module
 * now reporting snps summary
 * new script for building multi-sample snp matrix & fasta files

2015-08-22
 * switched back to uniform cutoffs for computing phyeco coverage
 * fixed bug when computing phyeco coverages

2015-08-20
 * added %id filter to SNPs module

2015-08-16
 * made arguments specific to pangenome and SNPs modules

2015-08-15
 * run_phylo_cnv.py: added --pangenome_pid option
 * phylo_cnv.py: added support for computing coverage of 90-99% id pangenes

2015-08-14
 * run_phylo_cnv.py: added --debug flag to print shell commands
 * phylo_cnv.py: added phyeco normalization
	-map reads to 15 phyeco genes using gene-specific mapping cutoffs
    -compute median coverage across 15 phyeco marker genes
